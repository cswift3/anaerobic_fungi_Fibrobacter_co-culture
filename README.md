Supplementary dataset S1. List of differentially regulated genes of A. robustus in co-culture with F. sp. UWB7 compared to A. robustus monoculture during growth on Avicel® PH-101 (absolute log2fold change less than 1 and adjusted p-value less than 0.05). Log2FC>1 signifies gene is upregulated in co-culture.

Supplementary dataset S2. List of differentially regulated genes of A. robustus in co-culture with F. sp. UWB7 compared to A. robustus monoculture during growth on switchgrass (absolute log2fold change less than 1 and adjusted p-value less than 0.05). Log2FC>1 signifies gene is upregulated in co-culture.

Supplementary dataset S3. List of differentially regulated genes of C. churrovis in co-culture with F. sp. UWB7 compared to C. churrovis monoculture during growth on switchgrass (absolute log2fold change less than 1 and adjusted p-value less than 0.05). Log2FC>1 signifies gene is upregulated in co-culture.

Supplementary dataset S4.Pre-ranked gene set enrichment analysis (Subramanian et al., 2005) for the gene set eukaryotic orthologous group (KOG) 0710, "small heat-shock protein Hsp20/Hsp42” in the differential expression results comparing A. robustus grown in monoculture to A. robustus co-cultured with F. UWB7 on Avicel growth substrate. The input expression data used was the log2fold change of monoculture vs. co-culture (negative values indicate upregulation in co-culture).

Supplementary dataset S5. Pre-ranked gene set enrichment analysis (Subramanian et al., 2005) for the gene set eukaryotic orthologous group (KOG) 0710, "small heat-shock protein Hsp20/Hsp42” in the differential expression results comparing A. robustus grown in monoculture to A. robustus co-cultured with F. UWB7 on switchgrass growth substrate. The input expression data used was the log2fold change of monoculture vs. co-culture (negative values indicate upregulation in co-culture).

Supplementary dataset S9. Counts of differentially regulated genes in each KOG class for C. churrovis in co-culture with F. sp. UWB7 on switchgrass as well as total predicted genes in each KOG class based on MycoCosm4 portal.

Supplementary dataset S10. List of differentially regulated genes of F. sp. UWB7 in co-culture with C. churrovis compared to F. sp. UWB7 monoculture during growth on switchgrass (absolute log2fold change less than 1 and adjusted p-value less than 0.05). Log2FC>1 signifies gene is upregulated in co-culture.
